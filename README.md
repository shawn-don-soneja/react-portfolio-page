I'm Shawn and this the repository for my personal portfolio website: <a href="https://www.shawnsoneja.com/">shawnsoneja.com</a>. My website breaks down into three sections:
### 1. Projects
Find some highlights of my work.
<br/>A cool one to check out is my <a href="https://www.shawnsoneja.com/#projects"><b>United States Macroeconomic Dashboard</b></a>, which tracks some key indicators for a consolidated view of the U.S. Macroeconomy, and overlays them with a trend line.

### 2. About
Learn a bit more about my background and goals.

### 3. Skills
